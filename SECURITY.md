## Reporting a Vulnerability

### 🚨 Important: Do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to ensure they can be addressed before public disclosure.

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to security@prism-browser.com
2. **PGP Key**: Use our PGP key for encrypted communication
3. **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 24 hours

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue

- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue

### Vulnerability Classification

We use the following severity levels:

#### 🔴 Critical
- Remote code execution
- Privilege escalation
- Data exfiltration
- Authentication bypass

#### 🟠 High
- Local privilege escalation
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)

#### 🟡 Medium
- Information leakage
- Limited denial of service
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Input validation issues

#### 🟢 Low
